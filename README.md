# housing-price-prediction-
In this project, I built a regression model to predict housing prices using historical property data. Using features like square footage, location, and number of bedrooms, the model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.77, indicating good predictive performance. I applied data cleaning, feature engineering, and model tuning for optimal results.
